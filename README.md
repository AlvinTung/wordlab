# wordlab2.0
Wordlab is a text mutator inspired by the Cut-up technique that was popularised by Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs. To use it simple paste in the text you want to mutate then click ‘Randomise’. ‘Group’ the interesting phrases and chains of words that will emerge by underlining it. Click ‘Randomise’ again. Again ‘Group’ the phrases and chains of words that pique your interest, or expand upon existing groups. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the finished product. You can add units of meaning under 10 categories or modes by highlighting text and selecting F0 - F9 under the 'Mutate' menu. Similarly you can insert a random unit of meaning into a text by using the shortcuts or selecting M0 - M9 under the 'Mutate' menu. 'U' button to select a random unit of meaning from out of the union of all modes.
